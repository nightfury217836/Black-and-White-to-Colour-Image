Bring your old black-and-white photos to life using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning! 🧠🎨

💡 Ever wondered if AI could restore and colorize vintage photos automatically?

In this video, I’ll show you how I built an AI-Powered Image Colorization System using Python, OpenCV, and Deep Learning — a complete end-to-end Computer Vision project that transforms grayscale images into realistic, vibrant color photos.

GitHub Code Link: 

We’ll go step-by-step:
✅ Load and use a pre-trained Caffe Deep Learning model
✅ Understand LAB color space and AI-based color prediction
✅ Convert grayscale images to LAB and preprocess input data
✅ Generate realistic color channels with OpenCV’s DNN module
✅ Merge and display the final colorized output side-by-side 🎞️

This is a full AI + Computer Vision project — perfect for students, beginners, and professionals who want to explore how Deep Learning can restore old photos and enhance images automatically.

✨ By the end, you’ll learn how to:
• Use OpenCV’s DNN module for real-world AI applications
• Work with LAB color models in Python
• Load and apply pre-trained deep learning models
• Build an interactive chatbot-style terminal project
• Create an AI that intelligently colorizes historical images

📌 Technologies Used:
Python 🐍 | OpenCV | NumPy | Deep Learning | Caffe Model

💬 Whether you’re starting in AI/ML or looking to build your portfolio with real-world projects, this tutorial shows how to turn creative ideas into fully functional AI-based image restoration tools.
